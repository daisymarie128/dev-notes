OpenFrameworks is an open source `C++` toolkit designed for creative coding and to assit people in there creative process. It was designed to be a simple and intuitive framework for experimentation.

It was made to be collaborative, usable and simple, consistent and intuitive, cross-platform, powerful, and extensible.

OpenFrameworks v0.01 was released by Zachary Lieberman in 2005 and by 2006 students of Loebermans at Parsons School of Design, New York City, were using it for their studies.
