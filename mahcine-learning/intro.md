# What is Machine Learning?

## The difference between *Artificial Intellegence*, *Deep Learning* and *Machine Learning*

### Machine Learning
Machine Learning is about teaching a computer, rather than giving it a specific set of functions to run. This is taught through data and recognising patterns. Machine Learning is built around algorithms (or sets of rules) that learn complex functions (or patterns) from the data it is given and making predictions on it - which is a form of narrow AI.

Machine Learning has a great deal to do with predicting stuff.

It does this intelligently by:
1. Taking some data (This is used to train our system)
2. Learns patterns from this data
3. Classifies new data it hasn't seen before â€“ and forms a guesse on what this data could be (based on knowledge learnt in step 2)

So what makes Machine Learning truely impressive is not just that it can recognise new information, that wasn't included in the data set it originally learnt from, but that it can continuously learn without re-writting the code.

So that same alorithm which it was taught on can be re-used to understand future information and classify them accordinly (given enough training data).

So if we take an example of how we are used to writting a program, using some simple logic such as `if else` statements:
```js
if mail contains deals
    then mark as junk-mail;
if mail contains ...
```

Rethinking our program using and algorithm: <!-- TODO: add more details example -->
```js
try to classify mail;
change self to reduce errors;
repeat;
```

*An approach to acheive artificial intellegence through systems that can learn from experience to find patterns in a set of data*

### Artificial Intellegence

This is an ever changing definition as Machine Learning and advancments in technology gets more advanced.

It is the science of making things smart. A good way to think of it is as *Human intellegence exhibited by machines"*.

Getting computers to perform human tasks.

#### Narrow AI

Is a term which describes a system that can perform one or a few small tasks, either as well as or better than a human can do.

> i.e recognising objects or gestures that we've trained it to understand.

This requires code written by a humen to create a system that can do this.

#### Use cases

- Object recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural Language Processing / Sentiment Analysis (Read more here)[] <!-- TODO: Research further -->
- Creativite *i.e Style Transfer - Learning to draw an image in the style of an artist*
- Prediction
- Translation
- Restoration / Transformation <!-- TODO: Research further -->

### Deep Learning

Is a technique for implementing Machine Learning.

One common technique is a concept known as *Deep Nueral Networks (DNNs)*

#### DNNs

To put it simply is when the code structures we write are arranged in layers that loosely mimic the human brain, learning patterns of patterns.
