## Machine Learning

### Supervised and unsupervised learning
There are two giant umbrella categories within Machine Learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.

#### Supervised Learning:
This type of learning is like data mining. You look through some data and see what you can pull out., you typically don't have much information before you start your process

#### Supervised Learning:
Starts with some "training data". Think of this type of learning like when you're a child, and your parents try to teach you what an apple is. They show you an apple, then the next day another apple, a different color and slightly off in shape. Next day the same thing, until you slowly can recognise an apple whenever you see one.
