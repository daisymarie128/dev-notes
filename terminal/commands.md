# Handy terminal tips

## Splitting panes
A handy thing I like to do with my terminal is split my pane in two.
`cmd + D` : split pane vertically 
`cmd + shift + D` : split pan horizontally

This is sort've like making a new tab, though however these panes stay inside the one tab.

Example of what a pane is.

## Multi-type cursor
`cmd + shift + i`

This allows you to type in multiple panes you have open.

This comes in handy in scenarios where maybe your on to different servers and need to run the same commands to check the differrences or see what each one has in them.

A nice time saver!
