# Accessibility
The web is fundamentally supposed to work all people, no matter what hardware, software, location or ability is.<br>
When these web standards are met, it means people with a diverse range of hearing, movement and sight can use webpages easily as well.

<br>

Accessibility is extremely important becasue everyone should be able to navigate through your site, no matter there ability to see, move or hear etc.<br>
Imagine being blind and trying to fill out a form online. In these scenarios it is crutial that our websites can still be used.<br>

Web accessability should be treated with great importance when building any site and should be a requirment for our sites.
