# Performance

Javascript is an integral part of most websites and can make applications more engaging and dynamic. Though because if this, if we write our code poorly or without considering optimisation it can hinder our users experience and can let users have different experiences depending on their devices.

## Common performance problems
- Too Many interactions with the host
- Too many dependencies
- Poor event handling
- Inefficient interactions
- Unorganized code

Heres some further elaboration on the above points:
### Too many interactions with the host:
- Can cuase Unpredictability and performance lag
- Can result in the DOM beggining to render slowly
- Though sometimes these interactions can't be avoided but keeping them to a minimum can help
- Also associated with [**DOM blocking**](./dom-blocking.md)

### Too many dependencies:
- Having a large amount of dependencies can cause performance and loading issues.
- Users can have to wait longer for pages or objects to render
- Also consider mobile users and the bandwidth this uses.

### Poor event handling



### Inefficient interactions:

### Unorganized code:
