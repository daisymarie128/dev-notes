## Mediator Pattern

This pattern allows us to expose a unified interface through which the different parts of a system may communicate.

**What it can help with**
If you start to notice your app has to many direct relationships between components, you can create a central point of control that components communicate through instead.

So instead of components referring to each other explicitly, the Mediator method promotes loose coupling, by making sure the components interactions are handled through this central point you create.

> This can help us decouple systems and improve the potential for component reusability.
