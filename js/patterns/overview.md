## Javascript Design Patterns

### Creational
Creational patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitble for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.<br>

Some creational patterns include:<br>
[Constructor](#Constructor)<br>
[Factory](#Factory)<br>
[Abstract](#Abstract)<br>
[Prototype](#Prototype)<br>
[Singleton](#Singleton)<br>
[Builder](#Builder)

### Structural
Structural patterns are focused on object composition and typically identify ways to realize relationsships between different objects. They try to ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same. They also help in recasting parts of the system which don't fit a particular purpose into those that do.

Some structuarl patterns include:<br>
[Decorator](#Decorator)<br>
[Facade](#Facade)<br>
[Flyweight](#Flyweight)<br>
[Adapter](#Adapter)<br>
[Proxy](#Proxy)

### Behavioral
Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.<br>

Some behavioral patterns include:<br>
[Iterator](#Iterator)<br>
[Mediator](#Mediator)<br>
[Observer](#Observer)<br>
[Visitor](#Visitor)
