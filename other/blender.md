### Short cuts

#### Select multiple faces
To select multiple faces quickly, one option is to `press alt` + `right mouse button`.

This selects either a whole row or column of what you're looking at. Also hold down `shit` while continuing to `press alt` + `right click` on different rows or columns to select lots of faces at once.

####### option 2
Hold down `control` + hold and drag with `left mouse button`. This acts like a lasso to select multiple items at once.

#### Create a new group from selected
With the things you want to cut away from the current model and put into a new object selected `press p` then select selection from options and the new group should appear in display panel.

> Remember to be in edit mode of your object to select faces, vertices or edges
