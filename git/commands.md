### Useful commands

##### Merge specific
You can first run `git log` â€“ to find the specific commit id you want to merge (it's the very long number)

Then to only merge that commit into the branch you want you return

`git cherry-pick [commit-id]`

This is useful if you've commited a few changes to the develop branch for example, and you don't want to push all those changes to the master branch just yet but you do have one important change that needs to happen. You can use this command.
