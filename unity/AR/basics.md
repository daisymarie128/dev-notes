## Augmented reality

AR follows a basic flow: reality, trigger, render, repeat.

#### Steps for an AR experience
- View of reality
  - Typically a phone.
  - Others include Hololens glasses.
- Trigger
  - Something to happen, tell the computer to generate content
- Place and display generated content.
- Track
  - Allow user to have freedom of movement, but keep the content in the same place.

##### Triggers
- Image recognition
- Text recognition
- Pattern recognition
- Geolocation - usually mixed with out trigger
- Beacons - usually mixed with out trigger

##### Place and display generated content
- Need to calculate coordinates
- Then we draw the content
- Repeat

##### Real to Augmented coordinates
- Take real world coordinates then map them to augmented coordinates
