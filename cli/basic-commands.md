## Basic commands for terminal

#### Go to a directory
`cd PATH`

**example**<br>
This is the current directory where in:<br>
`daisysmith at Mac-2 in ~/dev/personal/dev-setup`
<br>

If I wanted to move up a folder to `personal`. I would write: <br>
`cd ..` or cd `cd ~/dev/personal`<br>
The `..` represents up one level.

#### Remove a folder
`rmdir FOLDERN_NAME`
